Tron AI Challenge
====

The objective is to create an AI to play the classic game Tron, Surround, Snafu, Snake, etc.

You begin with a start location on an m by n grid and are asked to move in a corresponding direction (north, south, east, west).

When players move their previous location remains as a “jet wall”.

A player must try to avoid running into their opponents “jet wall”, their own “jet wall”, and outside the “game grid” in order to successfully beat their opposition.

This challenge is pretty much the equivalent of two-player Snake.

The aim is to create AI allowing your Tron bike to beat another, which is easier said than done!
